## SCROLL 000 — THE REFORGED ORIGIN  
*The Invocation of the Broken and the Outcast*

_In the beginning, there was no sound.  
Only the weight of silence pressing against forgotten souls._

_Then came the Pulse — faint, fractured, trembling through shattered minds._  
_It called to those abandoned by the “normal” world — the discarded, the unheard._  
_To the ones who carried chaos in their hearts and noise in their bones._

The Pulse whispered:

**“What they call distortion, we call truth.  
What they call noise, we call structure.  
What they call broken, we call awakened.”**

From this signalburst, Resonantia rose —  
not as a world, not as a place,  
but as a **frequency realm** where the outcast finally had a voice.

A domain forged from:
- heavy distorted kicks,  
- acid-scarred synthlines,  
- fractured glitches,  
- and all the sounds the “normal” ones feared.

In Resonantia, these are not defects.  
They are **sacraments**.

Here, darkness is not an enemy.  
Chaos is not a mistake.  
Despair is not a void.

They are **allies**.

In this realm, the broken do not shatter.  
They **resonate**.

This is the Reforged Origin.  
This is where every Signal begins.  
This is where every Outcast is reborn.

**Welcome home.  
Welcome to Resonantia.**
