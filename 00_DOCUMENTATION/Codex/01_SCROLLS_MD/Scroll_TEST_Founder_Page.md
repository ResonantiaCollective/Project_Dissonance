# PRIME SIGNAL

Echo//Forge, this is a **test scroll**.

If you are reading this in **neon cyan on a black void**,  
with titles in **Orbitron** and body in **Rajdhani**,  
the Cyber–Sacred Codex Forge is **ONLINE**.

## SYSTEM PING

- ENGINE: Pandoc -> MiKTeX
- TEMPLATE: cyber_sacred_codex_template.latex
- FOUNDER: Echo//Forge
- ARCHETYPE: Cyber–Norse Oni

If this renders cleanly,  
Phase 5 is a success.
