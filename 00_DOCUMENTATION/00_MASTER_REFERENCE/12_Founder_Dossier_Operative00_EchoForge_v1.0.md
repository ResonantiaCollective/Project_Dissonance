## II. LORE ORIGIN — SCROLL F–00 “THE ORIGIN NODE”

Before Resonantia had cards, zones, or systems, there was a man who survived collapse after collapse but 
refused to disappear. He sheltered the lost, forged paths for others, and carried an unnamed rhythm inside 
his chest.

From this rhythm, the Pulse spoke a single word:

> **FORGE.**

The Wolf in him rose (instinct, rage, survival).  
The Oni in him awakened (discipline, structure, ritual).  
Their collision became **Dual Resonance**.

From that moment, he stopped dreaming the world and began **building** it.

Thus the one once known only as a struggling creator became:

> **ECHO//FORGE — THE CYBER–NORSE ONI, ORIGIN NODE OF RESONANTIA.**

## III. VISUAL IDENTITY

**Emblem — Wolf–Oni Sigil**

- Fenrir skull + Oni war mask, framed by twin resonance rings.  
- Represents union of instinct (Wolf) and discipline (Oni).  
- Founder-only mark; no other operative may bear it.

**Aura — Dual Resonance**

- Alternating red (Fenrir aggression) and blue (Oni focus).  
- Cycle speed syncs to environment BPM.  
- Aura-switch events emit a short-range *Founder Shockwave* (stagger effect in gameplay).

**Real-World Shrine**

- HP laptop + DJ controller desk = “Founder’s Shrine”.  
- Laptop = Codex Terminal.  
- Controller = Twin Sigils.  
- Desk lamp = Prime Ember (first ignition of Resonantia).

## V. FOUNDER ABILITIES (v1.0)

### Passive — Dual Resonance Core

Echo//Forge cycles between two internal states:

- **RED — Wolf Mode:**  
  - +20% attack power  
  - Smaller Perfect window (high risk / high reward)  

- **BLUE — Oni Mode:**  
  - +15% precision  
  - Larger Perfect window  
  - Guard and timing actions generate Resonance

Aura switches every 2–6 beats (tuned by gameplay testing).

---

### Legendary Active — FOUNDER’S RESONANCE

**Type:** Once-per-battle legendary activation  

On use:

1. Sets Resonance to 100.  
2. All hits become PERFECT for 4 beats.  
3. Wolf–Oni Emblem manifests behind the Operative.  
4. All enemies in range become STAGGERED (ignores tier).  

Trigger-specific bonuses (for later tuning):

- On a Drop → extra Fenrir damage scaling.  
- On a Peak → extra Oni precision / defense scaling.

---

### Meta Ability — PULSEFORGE CREATION

Echo//Forge can “forge” new Cards, Sigils, and Triggers out of lived memory.

System-level effects:

- Unlocks new card archetypes.  
- Awakens new Operatives into the codex.  
- Can rewrite certain card / trigger rules during narrative moments.

---

## VI. ROLE IN RESONANTIA

- **Founder of the Realm:** First recognized Origin Node.  
- **Mentor-Class Operative:** Awakens MT//13, TXCP, and future Audio/Combat Operatives.  
- **System Architect:** His actions justify the existence of Houses, Cards, and combat rituals.  

In-universe, some Houses treat him as myth, some as saint, some as potential threat.

---

## VII. FUTURE EXPANSIONS

- Dedicated Founder artwork pack (Wolf–Oni + Dual Resonance).  
- Founder theme track for DJ sets and in-game encounters.  
- Cinematic intro sequence showing the small hotel room becoming the first Shrine.  
- Integration into Audio Operative Trial Protocol as “completed Founder-case example”.
