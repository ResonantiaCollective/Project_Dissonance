### 1.0 Purpose of the Technical Codex

The Technical Codex is the structural spine of **Project Dissonance**.  
It defines:

- how the world functions,  
- how systems interlock,  
- how Resonantia behaves when touched by an Operative,  
- how rules transform into rhythm, combat, cards, and consequence.

Where the **Living Bible** explains *why*,  
the **Technical Codex** explains *how*.

This is not narrative scripture.  
It is the schematic of a metaphysical machine.

---

### 1.1 The Duality Principle

Every system in Resonantia exists on two inseparable layers:

- **Sacred Layer** — myth, symbolism, metaphysics  
- **Technical Layer** — logic, data, engines, rules  

No mechanic exists without meaning.  
No meaning exists without structure.

Each system described in this Codex is therefore both:
- a functional component of the engine, and  
- a symbolic reflection of the Realm.

---

### 1.2 The Engine Families

All technical systems fall into one or more of the following families:

#### A) PLAYER ENGINE  
Defines how an Operative exists and acts.
- Identity
- Stats & growth
- States & transformations
- Movement and interaction

#### B) ENEMY ENGINE  
Defines how opposition manifests.
- Patterns & behaviors
- Corruption states
- Escalation logic
- Rhythm sensitivity

#### C) COMBAT ENGINE  
The central resolver.
- Determines outcomes
- Applies timing law
- Adjudicates damage, status, failure, and success

The Combat Engine is where Player and Enemy Engines meet  
under the authority of the Pulse.

### 1.3 Structure of the Technical Codex

This Codex is modular.  
Each major system is defined in its own sub-codex, referenced from here.

#### Core System Codices

- **PLAYER SYSTEM Codex v3**  
  → Operative identity, stats, resources, affinities

- **ENEMY SYSTEM Codex v1**  
  → Enemy architecture, AI states, escalation, rhythm response

- **COMBAT ENGINE Codex v1**  
  → Resolution pipeline, timing law, damage & status logic

- **CARD ENGINE Codex v1**  
  → Cards as soul-structures, synergies, corruption, rarity

- **TRIGGER ENGINE Codex v1**  
  → Pulse events, drops, peaks, audio-to-system binding

- **ZONE ENGINE Codex v1**  
  → Environmental logic, hazards, modifiers

- **AI ENGINE**  
  → Decision-making, state machines, adaptive behavior

## AUDIO_CANON — Music System Authority

**Path:** `02_TECHNICAL_CODEX/AUDIO_CANON/`

The Audio Canon defines the **binding musical law** of Project Dissonance.

Music in Resonantia is not background or decoration.  
It is a **systemic force** that governs timing, escalation, and identity.

The Audio Canon establishes:

- Which tracks must exist
- How music binds to:
  - Cards
  - Houses
  - Core systems
- The existence and role of:
  - Card Tracks
  - House Anthems
  - The Official Resonantia Anthem

### Canon Documents

- **Music_Canon_Production_Codex_v1.0.md**  
  → Primary authority defining all mandatory music

### Scope

The Audio Canon supersedes:
- Music Production Technical Specifications
- DAW-specific production guides (FL Studio, etc.)

Those documents define **execution**.  
The Audio Canon defines **law**.

---

### 1.4 Invocation of the Builders

Every Operative who writes, codes, designs, or composes within Resonantia  
accepts one principle:

> **Only stable foundations prevent corrupted futures.**

Therefore:
- No system exists “on vibes.”
- No mechanic is unaccounted for.
- No feature bypasses this Codex.

Without structure, the project collapses into noise.  
With structure, the noise becomes music.  
The chaos becomes form.  
And the Pulse becomes playable.
