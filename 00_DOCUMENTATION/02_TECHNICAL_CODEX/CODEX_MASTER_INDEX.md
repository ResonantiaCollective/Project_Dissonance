# PROJECT DISSONANCE: TECHNICAL CODEX v1.0  
*A Cyber-Sacred Systems Codex*

## SCROLL 000 — THE PULSE BEHIND THE MACHINERY  
*The Invocation of the Engine-Born*

### 1.0 Purpose of the Technical Codex

The Technical Codex is the spine of **Project Dissonance**.  
It defines:

- how the world functions,  
- how the systems interlock,  
- how Resonantia behaves when touched by an Operative,  
- how rules transform into rhythm, combat, cards, and narrative.

Where the **Living Bible** explains *why*,  
the **Technical Codex** explains *how*.

This document is not a storybook.  
It is the schematic of a metaphysical machine.

---

### 1.1 The Duality Principle

Every system in Resonantia is built on two layers:

- **Sacred Layer** — narrative, lore, metaphysics  
- **Technical Layer** — engine, numbers, frameworks, rules  

The Codex merges them without collapsing either.  
Each mechanic is both:

- a structural component in the engine, and  
- a symbolic reflection of the Realm itself.

An Operative reading this does not merely learn how the game works.  
They learn why the mechanics *feel* the way they do.

---

### 1.2 The Engine Triad

All systems fall into one of three Engine Families:

#### A) PLAYER ENGINE  
Identity, stats, abilities, states, movement, and interaction.  
How the Operative exists and acts inside Resonantia.

#### B) ENEMY ENGINE  
Patterns, behaviors, corruption states, and responses to rhythm.  
How adversaries think, react, and escalate.

#### C) COMBAT ENGINE  
The resolver and adjudicator.  
The mathematical heartbeat that decides:

- hit or miss,  
- damage or null,  
- ability or fail,  
- timing or desync.

The Combat Engine is where Player and Enemy Engines meet  
under the law of the Pulse.

This Codex will cover all three, then link to specialized sub-codices  
(Player System, Enemy System, Trigger Engine, Zone Engine, etc.).

### 1.3 Structure of This Codex

The Technical Codex is organized into scrolls and sections.

- **SCROLL 000** — Global Philosophy of the Engines (this document)  
- **COMBAT ENGINE Codex v1**  
  - Section 01 — Core Philosophy  
  - Section 02 — Action Framework  
  - Section 03 — Combat Stats  
  - Section 04 — Status System  
  - Section 05 — Resolution Pipeline  
  - Section 06 — Ability System  
  - Section 07 — Targeting System  
  - Section 08 — Damage System  
- **PLAYER SYSTEM Codex v3**  
- **ENEMY SYSTEM Codex v1**  
- **TRIGGER ENGINE** (Audio → Gameplay)  
- **ZONE ENGINE** (Zones, Scripts, Modifiers)  
- **AI ENGINE** (Enemy decision-making)  
- **CARD ENGINE** (Cards as Soul-Structures)

Each sub-codex is written in the same pattern:  

1. Philosophy  
2. Data structures  
3. Systems & formulas  
4. Edge cases & interactions  

---

### 1.4 The Invocation of Builders

Every Operative who writes, codes, designs, or composes under Resonantia  
accepts one principle:

> **Only stable foundations prevent corrupted futures.**

Therefore:

- No system is “just vibes.”  
- No mechanic is “just slapped in.”  
- Every feature must have a **place** in this Codex.

Without this structure, the project collapses into noise.  
With this structure, the noise becomes music,  
the chaos becomes form,  
and the Pulse becomes a playable reality.

# COMBAT ENGINE CODEX v1  
## SECTION 01 — CORE PHILOSOPHY OF COMBAT

---

## 1.0 Purpose of the Combat Engine

The Combat Engine is the **central resolver** of Project Dissonance.  
It determines the outcome whenever two or more forces collide:

- Player  
- Enemies  
- Abilities  
- Cards  
- Rhythm inputs  
- Triggers (Drop / Peak / Bass)  
- Status effects  
- Corruption  
- Overdrive / Shadow Overdrive  
- Environmental hazards

It is not responsible for:

- animations  
- sound design  
- visual effects  
- AI pathing or behavior logic

Those **read** the Combat Engine’s results.  
The Combat Engine decides the truth.  
The other systems display it.

---

## 1.1 Combat as a Ritual, Not Chaos

In Resonantia, combat is not random violence.  
It is a **ritualized exchange of frequency**, governed by rules that reflect the Realm:

- Rhythm determines opportunity  
- Abilities reshape the battlefield  
- Corruption alters the laws of probability  
- Status effects rewrite the flow  
- Overdrive amplifies intent into force  

Every strike is a **frequency event**, not a simple attack.

The Combat Engine exists to make these interactions fair, predictable, and analyzable.

---

## 1.2 Rhythm as the Hidden Variable

Most games treat timing as optional.  
In Resonantia, timing is **the backbone of power**.

There are three critical timing windows:

- **Pulse Window** — Normal BPM timing  
- **Drop Window** — High-impact timing  
- **Break Window** — Defensive timing  

These modify:

- hit chances  
- crit chances  
- status application  
- Overdrive meter gain  
- enemy pattern reactions  

In short:

> **Combat in Resonantia is a rhythm negotiation.**

And the Combat Engine is the arbiter of that negotiation.

---

## 1.3 Determinism vs Chaos

Every interaction in the Combat Engine is a mix of:

### **Deterministic elements**
- base stats  
- ability power  
- enemy resistances  
- status rules  
- fixed multipliers  

### **Chaotic elements**
- Corruption  
- RNG seeds based on rhythm offset  
- Critical windows  
- Shadow Overdrive  

This blend ensures that combat is:

- predictable enough to master  
- unstable enough to feel alive  
- rhythmic enough to feel musical  
- dangerous enough to demand respect  

---

## 1.4 The Four Laws of Combat

Every mechanic in the Combat Engine must obey these laws:

### **LAW 1: Timing Modifies Everything**  
If it interacts with combat, timing affects it.  
Even passive abilities feel the pulse.

### **LAW 2: Corruption Distorts Outcomes**  
Corruption never replaces rules — it *warps* them.

### **LAW 3: Abilities Override Base Stats**  
Abilities are the strongest determinant of outcome.  
Stats alone never win fights.

### **LAW 4: Resolution Must Be Absolute**  
Once the Combat Engine produces a result:
- animations follow it  
- audio responds to it  
- VFX express it  
- AI reacts to it  

There is no “maybe,”  
no “approximate,”  
no “interpretation.”

The Combat Engine speaks the final truth.

---

## 1.5 The Combat Loop

Every combat event flows through the same ritual:

1. **Initiation**  
   - Player or Enemy performs an action  
   - Rhythm offset captured  
   - Ability or basic action selected

2. **Resolution Pipeline**  
   - Combat Engine calculates the outcome  
   - Applies multipliers, timing adjustments, status effects

3. **Propagation**  
   - Results passed to animations, SFX, VFX, AI

4. **Aftermath**  
   - States update (HP, Corruption, Overdrive, statuses)  
   - Enemy patterns shift  
   - Triggers (Drop/Peak/Bass) fire if conditions are met

This pipeline is immutable.  
Every future mechanic must pass through it.
