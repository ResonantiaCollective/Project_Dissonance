# Card — FEN-01 SURGE

## Metadata
- **ID**: fen_01_surge
- **Display Name**: SURGE
- **Version**: v1.0 (CANON LOCKED)
- **House**: Fenrir
- **Type**: OFFENSE / RHYTHM
- **Rarity**: Legendary (house canonical)
- **Tags**: [surge, timing, burst]

## Description
- Short: Converts perfect timing into decisive force.
- Long: SURGE is an immediate, high-pressure burst card tied to perfect-timing mechanics. It punishes hesitation, shatters resistance on perfect hits, and enforces sustained aggression.

## Known Parameters (from Production Notes)
- **Associated track**: FEN-01_SURGE (202 BPM)
- **Energy Role**: Burst Aggression
- **Design rules**: No intro; first impact within 2 bars; rhythmic clarity prioritized.

## Production & Canon Obligations
- Follow `Music_Canon_Production_Codex_v1.0.md` (Card Track Canon & Delivery rules).
- Required deliverables for the associated track:
	- `00_PROJECT/FEN-01_SURGE_v1.0.flp` (exists)
	- `01_AUDIO/STEMS/` (export stems and document routing)
	- `02_EXPORT/MASTER/FEN-01_SURGE_MASTER_v1.0.wav` (24-bit, 44.1/48kHz)
	- `02_EXPORT/SYSTEM_EDIT/FEN-01_SURGE_SYSTEM_v1.0.wav` (engine-ready)

## BPM / Timing
- Canon BPM: **202 BPM** (fixed). All system integration and timing windows must use this BPM unless a documented system edit is provided.

## Stats (TBD)
- **Cost**: TBD
- **Effects**: On PERFECT timing: apply heavy frequency damage and strong stagger. On hit window miss: reduced effect.
- **Duration / Cooldown**: TBD

## Play Patterns & Notes
- Openers and clutch plays; enforces repetition and pressure. Synergizes with mechanics that refresh cooldowns on rhythmic actions.

## Visuals & Audio
- Art placeholder: `Project_Dissonance/03_ART/cards/final/` (no final art yet)
