## Structure
- `<ENGINE>_INDEX.md` — Overview and routing  
- `Scroll_000_*` — Foundational principles and architecture  
- `Section_01` — Core rules  
- `Section_02+` — Subsystems and advanced layers  
- `Section_08` — Finalization layer

## Purpose
Define all logic, behaviors, rules, and interactions for this engine in a modular, codex-driven manner.

Engines are designed to integrate seamlessly while being independently maintainable.

## Editing Policy
- Each section must be self-contained.  
- Cross-references between engines must reference INDEX, not specific sections.  
- Version all major changes.
