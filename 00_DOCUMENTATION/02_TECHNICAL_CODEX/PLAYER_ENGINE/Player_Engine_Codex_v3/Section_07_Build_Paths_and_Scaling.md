# PLAYER ENGINE CODEX v3.0  
## SECTION 07 — BUILD PATHS & SCALING MODELS  
*An Operative is not chosen — they are built.*

---

## 7.0 Purpose

Build Paths define **how an Operative evolves**.

They combine:

- primary stats  
- secondary stats  
- ability unlocks  
- corruption interactions  
- rhythm mastery  
- resource dynamics  
- transformation affinity  

Builds must be expressive but balanced — no path should invalidate others.

---

## 7.1 Build Archetypes

There are **five universal build classes**, each tuned for different playstyles:

---

### **1. BRUTALIST**  
*Strength from force.*

Focus:
- PWR scaling  
- physical attacks  
- OD-enhanced burst  

Strengths:
- high ATK  
- strong stagger potential  
- high OD gain  

Weaknesses:
- vulnerable to corruption distortion  
- lower crit consistency  
- weaker ranged output  

---

### **2. PRECISION**  
*Strength from control.*

Focus:
- FCS_OP scaling  
- crit builds  
- rhythm precision  

Strengths:
- high crit chance/damage  
- strong ability scaling  
- rhythmic consistency  

Weaknesses:
- fragile  
- vulnerable to corruption-induced timing drift  

---

### **3. RHYTHM SAVANT**  
*Strength from the Pulse.*

Focus:
- RHM_OP scaling  
- perfect timing windows  
- resource generation through rhythm  

Strengths:
- unmatched resource economy  
- unmatched OD stability  
- rhythm-enhanced mobility  

Weaknesses:
- must maintain timing  
- corruption heavily punishes mistakes  

---

### **4. SHADOW TYPE**  
*Strength from corruption.*

Focus:
- corruption synergy  
- SOD optimization  
- instability management  

Strengths:
- highest potential damage  
- corrupted ability variants  
- strong in corrupted zones  

Weaknesses:
- unstable  
- risk of self-harm  
- high skill requirement  

---

### **5. SENTINEL**  
*Strength from defense.*

Focus:
- VIT_OP and RSL_OP scaling  
- tank mechanics  
- guard systems  

Strengths:
- high survivability  
- reliable under corruption  
- strong guard/parry output  

Weaknesses:
- lower damage  
- slower movement  
- weaker in high rhythm-demand scenarios  

---

## 7.2 Scaling Models

Stats scale differently depending on archetype.

Scaling models define how **PWR, FCS_OP, VIT_OP, AGI, RSL_OP, RHM_OP** progress as the Operative levels.

Three main scaling curves:

### **A) Linear Scaling**
Consistent per-level increases.

Used for:
- VIT_OP  
- RSL_OP  

### **B) Mixed Scaling**
Linear early-game → diminishing returns late-game.

Used for:
- PWR  
- FCS_OP  

### **C) Burst Scaling**
Strong early spikes → plateau → late-game spike.

Used for:
- RHM_OP  
- AGI  

Burst scaling supports rhythm-first or mobility-first playstyles.

## 7.3 Build Interaction with Stats

Each archetype influences stat priorities:

| Archetype      | PWR | FCS_OP | VIT_OP | AGI | RSL_OP | RHM_OP |
|----------------|-----|--------|--------|-----|--------|--------|
| Brutalist      | ★★★★☆ | ★☆☆☆☆ | ★★☆☆☆ | ★★★☆☆ | ★☆☆☆☆ | ★☆☆☆☆ |
| Precision      | ★★☆☆☆ | ★★★★★ | ★☆☆☆☆ | ★★☆☆☆ | ★☆☆☆☆ | ★★★☆☆ |
| Rhythm Savant  | ★★☆☆☆ | ★★★☆☆ | ★☆☆☆☆ | ★★★☆☆ | ★★☆☆☆ | ★★★★★ |
| Shadow Type    | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★☆ | ★☆☆☆☆ | ★★☆☆☆ | ★☆☆☆☆ | ★★★★☆ |
| Sentinel       | ★★☆☆☆ | ★★☆☆☆ | ★★★★★ | ★☆☆☆☆ | ★★★★★ | ★☆☆☆☆ |

Stars indicate emphasis.

## 7.4 Ability Unlock Trees

Ability progression follows:

- **core abilities** (always unlocked)  
- **branch abilities** (choose one of two)  
- **special abilities** (build-specific)  
- **corrupted abilities** (Shadow builds only)  
- **perfect-timing upgrades** (Rhythm builds only)

Each ability node may provide:

- new ability  
- improved scaling  
- altered rhythm affinity  
- corrupted variant  
- defensive modifier  

Ability Trees must:

- never dead-end  
- allow re-specialization (with resource cost)  
- support hybrid builds  

---

## 7.5 Card Synergy Layers

Builds influence card draw and card performance.

Brutalist:
- prefers heavy-hit cards  
- multipliers apply to physical cards  

Precision:
- crit cards are enhanced  
- cards that reward PERFECT hits scale better  

Rhythm Savant:
- cards that depend on timing or sequencing  

Shadow Type:
- corrupted card variants  
- risk/reward dynamic  

Sentinel:
- defensive and stability cards  

Cards interact with Builds, not replace them.

---

## 7.6 Resource Synergy

Each build interacts uniquely with Energy, Overdrive, and SOD:

Brutalist:
- high OD gain  
- OD amplifies burst  

Precision:
- cheap abilities  
- crit increases OD  

Rhythm Savant:
- PERFECT hits generate huge OD  
- energy refunds  

Shadow Type:
- SOD synergy  
- corrupted abilities higher efficiency  

Sentinel:
- reduced OD decay  
- resist corruption effects  

---

## 7.7 Corruption Synergy

Shadow builds thrive under high corruption.

Others struggle unless specialized:

- Precision suffers distortion  
- Rhythm Savant becomes unstable  
- Brutalist may experience PWR spikes  
- Sentinel resists corruption effects  

This creates meaningful identity differentiation.

---

## 7.8 Build Selection Rules

Build choice must always be:

- clear  
- meaningful  
- branchable  
- reversible  
- scalable  

Players may mix archetypes → hybrid builds.

But hybrids:

- gain versatility  
- lose specialization bonuses  

This keeps builds balanced.

---

## 7.9 Scaling Integrity Rules

1. Builds must remain viable across the game.  
2. No build may invalidate another.  
3. Scaling must not produce exponential runaway stats.  
4. Corruption synergy must always have downsides.  
5. Rhythm builds must not bypass timing difficulty.  
6. Shadow builds must remain high-risk, high-reward.  
7. Defensive builds must not become immortal.  
8. Mixed builds must remain weaker than pure builds in specialized contexts.  
9. All scaling curves must be versioned for balance patches.  
10. Stat transformations must be reversible when respec occurs.
