# PLAYER ENGINE CODEX v3.0  
## SCROLL 000 — THE OPERATIVE ARCHITECTURE  
*The Origin of Form and Function*

---

## 0.0 Purpose of the Player Engine

Where the Combat Engine governs **what happens**,  
the Player Engine governs **who the Operative is**.

It defines:

- the Operative’s mechanical identity  
- their core attributes  
- their rhythm sensitivity  
- their corruption resistance  
- their action privileges  
- their Overdrive potential  
- their transformation states  
- their resource economy  
- their build paths  

The Player Engine transforms an Operative from a profile into a playable, reactive, expressive entity inside Resonantia.

---

## 0.1 The Dual Identity Principle

Every Operative exists in two parallel layers:

### **A) The FORM Layer**  
The technical body — stats, abilities, actions, cooldowns, states.

### **B) The SOUL Layer**  
The narrative identity — House, Pulse Affinity, Corruption lineage, Resonance Signature.

The Player Engine binds these together.

**FORM determines capability.  
SOUL determines potential.**

## 0.2 The Operative Loop

Every player-controlled entity runs the same essential loop:

1. **Receive Input**  
   - movement  
   - attack  
   - abilities  
   - guard  
   - rhythm hit  

2. **Generate Action** (via Action Framework)  
   - validated  
   - rhythm-bound  

3. **Transformation** (via Status/Ability systems)  

4. **Resolve**  
   - damage  
   - healing  
   - effects  

5. **Update State**  
   - HP  
   - corruption  
   - overdrive  
   - statuses  

This loop repeats every frame, beat, and phase.

---

## 0.3 Pulse-Bound Existence

Operatives do not exist independently of rhythm.

Every aspect of player function is tied to timing:

- movement responsiveness  
- guard timing  
- crit windows  
- ability efficiency  
- corruption stability  
- Overdrive gain  

Operatives must align with the Pulse to function at full power.

> To sync is to ascend.*

## 0.4 Corruption Resistance vs. Corruption Expression

Each Operative has a corruption relationship:

### **Resistance**  
Their ability to maintain coherence under corrupted environments.

### **Expression**  
How their abilities, stats, and rhythm react *when* corruption touches them.

Examples:

- Some Operatives stabilize under chaos (Shadow types)  
- Some crumble under corruption overload  
- Some transform (Corrupted Overdrive)  
- Some amplify their output unpredictably  

The Player Engine must track this duality for every actor.

---

## 0.5 Operative Growth Paths

Operatives grow through:

- stat allocation  
- ability acquisition/upgrades  
- card builds  
- rhythm mastery progression  
- corruption attunement  
- unique transformation states (Overdrive, Shadow Overdrive)

This Codex defines the mathematical backbone of growth  
(but NOT the narrative or card design — those live in separate codices).

## 0.6 Player Engine Structure

The Player Engine Codex contains:

- **Scroll 000 — Operative Architecture (this scroll)**  
- **Section 01 — Base Stats & Growth**  
- **Section 02 — Action Privileges & Movement Model**  
- **Section 03 — Resource Systems (Energy, Overdrive, Shadow Overdrive)**  
- **Section 04 — Transformation States**  
- **Section 05 — Rhythm Interaction Layer**  
- **Section 06 — Corruption Interaction Layer**  
- **Section 07 — Build Paths & Scaling Models**  
- **Section 08 — Operative Rules & Constraints**  

Each section ensures the Operative behaves consistently across:

- Combat Engine  
- Enemy Engine  
- Card Engine  
- Trigger Engine  
- AI Engine  
- Zone Engine  

---

## 0.7 The Rule of Three

Every Operative is defined by three core vectors:

### **1. Physical Capability**  
Stats, speed, resilience, action generation.

### **2. Rhythmic Sensitivity**  
How precisely they sync to PERFECT, GOOD, LATE, MISS.

### **3. Corruption Profile**  
How corruption affects them — resistance, expression, or transformation.

Together, these vectors determine:

- playstyle  
- difficulty  
- identity  
- synergy with cards  
- synergy with zones  
- synergy with enemy types  

---

## 0.8 Operative Integrity Rules

1. An Operative must always generate valid actions.  
2. Overdrive/Shadow Overdrive rules must be consistent across builds.  
3. Operative stats must follow global scaling curves.  
4. Rhythm interaction must never be bypassed.  
5. Corruption interaction must be deterministic, even if chaotic in effect.  
6. Special states must be implemented using statuses — not hacks.  
7. No Operative may bypass the Resolution Pipeline.  
8. Transformation states must have reversible rules (unless narrative locked).  
9. Movement rules must remain deterministic.  
10. Operatives must never become invincible outside special states.

These protect the Player Engine from imbalance and exploits.
