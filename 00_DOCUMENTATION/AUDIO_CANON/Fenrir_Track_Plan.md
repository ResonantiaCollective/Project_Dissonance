# Fenrir Track & Release Plan

This file lists Fenrir tracks found in the project and a short release plan aligned with existing canon (FEN-01..FEN-04).

## Found / Realized Tracks
- `Project_Dissonance/02_AUDIO/tracks/fenrir/FEN-01_SURGE/` — canonical production notes and project files (`FEN-01_SURGE_v1.0.flp`, stems/export placeholders). Status: production notes & canon locks present.

## Canon Deliverables Status (per Music Canon & Production Codex)
- Required: `00_PROJECT/<TRACK_ID>_vX.X.flp` — FOUND: `FEN-01_SURGE_v1.0.flp` in `00_PROJECT/`.
- Required: `01_AUDIO/STEMS/` — STATUS: placeholder exists; confirm exported stems in `01_AUDIO/STEMS/`.
- Required: `02_EXPORT/MASTER/` — STATUS: placeholder only (.gitkeep). Master WAV export missing; action required.
- Required: `02_EXPORT/SYSTEM_EDIT/` — STATUS: placeholder only; system-ready edit missing.
- Required: `03_NOTES/<TRACK_ID>_Production_Notes.md` — FOUND and canon-locked: `FEN-01_SURGE_Production_Notes.md`.

## Immediate Canon Actions (ordered)
1. Export and place canonical master: `02_EXPORT/MASTER/FEN-01_SURGE_MASTER_v1.0.wav` (24-bit, 48 kHz recommended).
2. Create a system-ready edit: `02_EXPORT/SYSTEM_EDIT/FEN-01_SURGE_SYSTEM_v1.0.wav` (trimmed for engine use, loop-safe if required).
3. Export stems into `01_AUDIO/STEMS/` (labeled and documented in `03_NOTES/`), include mix notes and channel routing.
4. Produce or assign artwork for single release and place under `01_ARTWORK/` according to Records structure.
5. Complete `Resonantia_Records/01_ARTISTS/Fenrir/FEN-01_SURGE_Release_Checklist.md` (this repo contains a checklist template created alongside this plan).

## Canon Validation Quick-Checklist
- [ ] FLP file present and versioned (00_PROJECT) — YES
- [ ] Production notes complete (03_NOTES) — YES
- [ ] Stems exported to `01_AUDIO/STEMS/` — NO / placeholder only
- [ ] Master exported to `02_EXPORT/MASTER/` — NO
- [ ] System edit exported to `02_EXPORT/SYSTEM_EDIT/` — NO
- [ ] Artwork assigned and present in Records — NO (use Echo_Forge artwork or commission)

Notes: Follow the Export & Naming rules in `Music_Canon_Production_Codex_v1.0.md` when creating files.

## Immediate actions (next 2 weeks)
1. Finalize master export for `FEN-01_SURGE` from `00_PROJECT` to `02_EXPORT/MASTER/` as WAV 24/48 (or repo standard). Verify canonical levels per `FEN-01_SURGE_Production_Notes.md`.
2. Prepare SoundCloud release entry for `FEN-01_SURGE` (free upload) using `Resonantia_Records` templates: include artwork, short description, and link to Fenrir arc docs.
3. Create a release checklist file under `Resonantia_Records/01_ARTISTS/Fenrir/` (or reuse `MollyTude_ONI13` structure) — include stems, master, artwork, metadata, EPK notes.

## 1–3 month roadmap
- Week 0–2: `FEN-01_SURGE` SoundCloud drop (free). Announce via socials, attach production notes excerpt.
- Week 3–6: Prepare Fenrir 4-track mini-EP (SURGE, FRACTURE, RECLAIM, DOMINION). Finalize partially-complete tracks, master batch, commission/assign cover art.
- Week 6–10: Release mini-EP as label release (Bandcamp / distribution) with pre-order or timed drop.

## DJ set / House intent note
- Fenrir material (202 BPM) is not House-tempo native. For a House-intent DJ set, select tracks from `Resonantia_Records/03_SETS` and `Resonantia_Samples` that match House tempo (120–130 BPM) or produce an uptempo edit/selection. Consider making two separate sets: one House-focused (free SoundCloud sets) and one Resonantia-hard/uptempo set featuring Fenrir material.

## Ownership & Canon
- `Resonantia_First_Pulse` continuous mix is uploaded to SoundCloud (Echo_Forge set); align Fenrir single drop messaging to reference the mix where appropriate.
