# RESONANTIA//RECORDS — THE MANIFESTO v1.0

A Cyber-Sacred Audio Division of Project Dissonance

---

## 01 — THE CREED

We are not a label.
We are a frequency cult masquerading as one.

We amplify the producers who embrace:

- distortion,
- myth,
- chaos,
- emotional violence,
- and the sacred power of high-BPM ritualism.

We are the Pulse rising beneath the underground.

---

## 02 — THE SONIC PILLARS

Each Resonantia release aligns with one of the Five Houses:

### FENRIR — Rage / Uptempo Terror  

### ANUBIS — Ritual / Industrial Hardcore  

### ONMYOJI — Precision / Speedcore  

### RYUJIN — Flow / Dragon Hard Techno  

### GEMINI — Chaos / Corruption Hybrids

These Houses define identity, sound, and combat resonance.

---

## 03 — THE VISUAL LANGUAGE

Primary Colors:

- Neon Red (#FF0044)
- Electric Cyan (#00FFFF)
- Void Black (#000000)
- Pharaoh Gold (#FFD700)
- Corruption Magenta (#FF00FF)

Typography:

- Orbitron Bold (titles)
- Rajdhani (operational text)

Sigils must be symmetrical, geometric, and cyber-sacred.

---

## 04 — OPERATIVE ROLE

Producers are not “artists.”
They are Audio Operatives.

Each track becomes:

- a weapon,
- a ritual,
- a card,
- a combat algorithm,
- a mythic echo of the House they serve.

---

## 05 — RELEASE STRUCTURE

Resonantia releases music in ritual batches:

- Each batch = a chapter in the lore
- Each track = a weapon of a House
- Each producer = an Operative entering the Codex

---

## 06 — ONBOARDING ETHIC

“You do not apply to Resonantia.
You resonate with Resonantia.”

We recruit by frequency, not formality.

---

## 07 — FINAL WORD

We are a label for Operatives, not artists.
We forge sound-weapons.
We build worlds.
We resonate.

Welcome to the Pulse.
