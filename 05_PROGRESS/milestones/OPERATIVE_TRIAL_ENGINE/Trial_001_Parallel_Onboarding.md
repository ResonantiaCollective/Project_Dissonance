# Trial_001 — Parallel Operative Onboarding
## Operative Trial Engine — System Validation Log

**Project:** Resonantia Collective  
**Division:** Project Dissonance  
**Trial ID:** TRIAL_001_PARALLEL_ONBOARDING  
**Trial Type:** Audio Operative — Training Variant  
**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Visibility:** FOUNDER ONLY (PRIVATE)  
**Observer:** Commandant Echo-Forge  
**System Oversight:** Sigma-Prime

## 1. PURPOSE OF THIS TRIAL

This trial exists to validate the **Operative Integration Protocol** as a system — not to validate individuals.

Two operatives are onboarded in parallel under **identical conditions**, framed as strangers to the system, in order to:

- Detect ambiguity in instructions
- Measure behavioral responses to structure
- Observe communication patterns under constraint
- Evaluate fairness and signal clarity
- Identify failure points in the onboarding pipeline

This document records **system behavior under load**.

## 2. TRIAL DESIGN OVERVIEW

### 2.1 Trial Structure

- Parallel onboarding
- Identical briefing content
- Identical deadlines
- Identical silence policy
- Identical evaluation criteria
- No corrective intervention

Operatives are **not informed** that this is a comparative or system-validation trial.

---

### 2.2 Operative Labels (Blind)

| Label | Operative Identity | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| A    | [REDACTED]        | Identity revealed post-evaluation |
| B    | [REDACTED]        | Identity revealed post-evaluation |

All scoring and observations are recorded using **A / B identifiers only** until blind review is complete.

## 4. OBSERVATION AXES

> Only **observable signals** are logged.  
> No interpretation, intent, or personal judgment.

### 4.1 Communication Signals

| Signal | Operative A | Operative B |
|------|------------|------------|
| Time to receipt confirmation |  |  |
| Questions asked (Y/N) |  |  |
| Nature of questions |  |  |
| Tone clarity (Neutral / Unclear) |  |  |
| Ghosting detected (Y/N) |  |  |

---

### 4.2 Process Compliance

| Metric | Operative A | Operative B |
|------|------------|------------|
| Followed file naming |  |  |
| Correct export formats |  |  |
| README included |  |  |
| README completeness |  |  |
| Deadline met |  |  |

---

### 4.3 Output Compliance

| Metric | Operative A | Operative B |
|------|------------|------------|
| Subgenre accuracy |  |  |
| Structure adherence |  |  |
| Drop variation present |  |  |
| Loudness target met |  |  |
| Technical issues detected |  |  |

---

## 5. FRICTION LOG

Record **where the system caused friction**, not where the operative “failed”.

Examples:
- Instruction ambiguity
- Missing clarification
- Overloaded constraints
- Implicit assumptions
- Silence thresholds

[Timestamp]
Observed friction:
System component affected:
Impact severity: Low / Medium / High

## 6. BLIND EVALUATION SUMMARY

> Completed **before** identity reveal.

### 6.1 Scores

| Category | Operative A | Operative B |
|--------|------------|------------|
| Technical Quality (40) |  |  |
| Aesthetic Accuracy (30) |  |  |
| Structure (20) |  |  |
| Creative Identity (10) |  |  |
| **TOTAL (100)** |  |  |

---

### 6.2 Preliminary Outcome

- Operative A Outcome:  
- Operative B Outcome:  

(No identity attached at this stage.)

---

## 7. IDENTITY REVEAL (POST-BLIND)

- Operative A =  
- Operative B =  

Compare:
- Expected vs actual performance
- Prior familiarity bias
- Confidence vs delivery gap

---

## 8. SYSTEM REVIEW QUESTIONS

Answer **only after identity reveal**:

- Did the system reward the correct behaviors?
- Did ambiguity affect one operative more than the other?
- Did silence policy hold?
- Was the scoring matrix sufficient?
- Did prior context leak into evaluation?

---

## 9. SYSTEM DECISION

Choose one:

- [ ] LOCK — Integration Protocol v1.0  
- [ ] PATCH — Proceed to v1.1  

If PATCH, specify:

- Section to adjust:
- Reason:
- Proposed change:

---

## 10. FINAL NOTES (SYSTEM-ONLY)

This trial does not define the worth of operatives.  
It defines the **resilience and clarity of the system**.

Future onboarding pipelines depend on what is learned here.
