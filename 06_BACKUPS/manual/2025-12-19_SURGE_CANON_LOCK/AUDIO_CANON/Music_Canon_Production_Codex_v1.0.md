# MUSIC CANON & PRODUCTION CODEX v1.0  

## Project Dissonance — Audio System Authority

---

## SECTION 0 — CANON DECLARATION

### 0.1 Purpose of This Codex

This document defines the **binding musical law** of Project Dissonance.

Music in Resonantia is not:
- background,
- decoration,
- mood filler,
- or post-production polish.

Music is a **systemic force**.

It governs:
- timing and escalation,
- identity and allegiance,
- emotional truth,
- ritual progression,
- resonance between Operative, Card, Enemy, and Zone.

Where other documents explain **how to produce music**,  
this Codex defines **what must exist**.

This document is **authoritative**.

---

### 0.2 Canon Authority

The Music Canon & Production Codex holds authority over:

- Card-related music
- House-related music
- Anthemic works
- System-critical musical identity

It supersedes:
- Music Production Technical Specifications
- DAW-specific production guides
- Individual producer preferences

Those documents describe **execution**.  
This Codex defines **law**.

If a conflict exists, **this document prevails**.

---

### 0.3 Scope of the Audio Canon

This Codex governs the existence and identity of:

1. **Card Tracks**  
   Every Card that manifests as a playable soul-structure  
   must have a corresponding musical expression.

2. **House Anthems**  
   Each House must possess a defining anthem  
   expressing its philosophy, temperament, and rhythm law.

3. **The Official Resonantia Anthem**  
   A singular work representing the Pulse itself  
   and the totality of the Project Dissonance universe.

This Codex does **not** define:
- mixing techniques,
- mastering chains,
- DAW workflows (yet),
- plugin choices.

Those are handled downstream.

---

### 0.4 Music as System Law

Music interacts directly with:

- the **Trigger Engine** (Pulse, Drop, Peak),
- the **Combat Engine** (timing, escalation),
- the **Card Engine** (activation, identity),
- the **Player & Enemy Systems** (pressure and response).

Therefore:

> **No music may exist without a system role.**  
> **No system role may exist without musical intent.**

Every track defined here is **mandatory**,  
even if not immediately produced.

---

### 0.5 Canon Lock Rules

Once a track is declared in this Codex:

- Its **existence** is canon-locked.
- Its **identity** (purpose, role, association) is canon-locked.
- Its **production** may evolve over time.

Version updates may:
- refine arrangement,
- improve sound design,
- adapt to system changes.

Version updates may **not**:
- remove a required track,
- reassign its core purpose,
- contradict its declared role.

---

### 0.6 Intended Audience

This Codex is written for:

- Audio Operatives
- System Designers
- Lead Producers
- Canon Keepers

It assumes:
- familiarity with Project Dissonance,
- respect for system integrity,
- willingness to treat music as law, not asset.

---

### 0.7 Reading Order

This Codex is structured as follows:

- **Section 0** — Canon Declaration & Law  
- **Section 1** — The Role of Music in Resonantia  
- **Section 2** — Card Track Canon  
- **Section 3** — House Anthems  
- **Section 4** — The Official Resonantia Anthem  
- **Section 5** — Production Obligations  
- **Section 6** — FL Studio 2024 (Canonical Workflow)  
- **Section 7** — Versioning & Canon Evolution

Each section builds on the previous one.  
No section may be skipped by contributors.

---

## SECTION 1 — THE ROLE OF MUSIC IN RESONANTIA

### 1.0 Music as Structural Force

In Project Dissonance, music is not an accessory to the experience.  
It is a **structural force** that shapes reality.

The Pulse does not accompany the world.  
The world forms **around** it.

Every system in Resonantia is affected by music in one or more of the following ways:

- timing and opportunity,  
- pressure and escalation,  
- identity and allegiance,  
- emotional truth,  
- ritual progression.

Without music, systems lose coherence.  
Without systems, music loses purpose.

Resonantia exists only where both are bound.

---

### 1.1 Music as Timekeeper

Music defines **time** inside Resonantia.

The Pulse establishes:
- tempo,
- anticipation,
- release,
- recovery.

Player actions, enemy patterns, and system triggers do not occur *in time*.  
They occur **because of it**.

The beat is not a background metronome.  
It is the clock by which all systems measure validity.

To act off-beat is not merely a mistake.  
It is a rejection of the world’s timing law.

---

### 1.2 Music as Pressure

Music is the primary vector of **pressure**.

As intensity rises:
- enemy aggression escalates,
- windows tighten,
- punishment becomes sharper,
- reward becomes rarer.

This escalation is not arbitrary.  
It is authored through music.

The louder, faster, or denser the signal becomes,  
the more the Realm demands precision.

In this way, difficulty is not “set.”  
It is **felt**.

---

### 1.3 Music as Identity

Every musical structure implies allegiance.

Genre, tempo, rhythm density, and tonal language  
all encode **philosophy**.

Houses are not defined by banners alone.  
They are defined by how they **sound**.

To hear a House anthem is to understand:
- how it values force or restraint,
- whether it rewards chaos or control,
- how it responds to disruption.

Music communicates identity faster than words.  
Therefore, it is binding.

---

### 1.4 Music as Ritual

Combat, progression, and mastery in Resonantia  
are not tasks — they are **rituals**.

Music marks:
- initiation,
- escalation,
- climax,
- aftermath.

These phases mirror the structure of both:
- musical composition, and
- mythic trial.

The Operative does not grind systems.  
They participate in cycles of resonance.

Music ensures those cycles are felt,  
remembered,  
and respected.

---

### 1.5 Music as Truth

Visuals can lie.  
Numbers can be abstracted.  
Text can be misread.

Music cannot.

When the signal swells, danger is real.  
When the rhythm fractures, corruption is present.  
When silence falls, something has ended.

Music carries emotional truth  
that systems alone cannot express.

For this reason:

> **If the music is wrong, the system is wrong.**

This Codex exists to prevent that failure.

---

### 1.6 Consequence of Absence

Any Card, House, or System  
without a defined musical role  
is considered **incomplete**.

It may exist in prototype form,  
but it may not be considered canon-ready.

Music is not added at the end.  
It is declared at the beginning.

---

## SECTION 2 — CARD TRACK CANON

### 2.0 Cards as Musical Entities

In Project Dissonance, Cards are not abstract modifiers.  
They are **soul-structures**.

Each Card represents:
- a philosophy of action,
- a tactical intent,
- a relationship to rhythm,
- a fragment of the Pulse made playable.

Therefore:

> **Every Card that exists in canon must have a corresponding track.**

This track is not background music.  
It is the **audible expression** of the Card’s nature.

---

### 2.1 Purpose of Card Tracks

Card Tracks serve four simultaneous roles:

1. **Identity**  
   They define how a Card *feels* before it is understood mechanically.

2. **System Reinforcement**  
   They reinforce timing windows, escalation, and activation states.

3. **Cognitive Anchoring**  
   They allow the Operative to recognize a Card by sound alone.

4. **Canon Binding**  
   They permanently bind a Card to the musical language of Resonantia.

A Card without a track is incomplete.  
A track without a Card is non-canon.

---

### 2.2 Card Track Obligations

For every Card declared in canon, the following must exist:

- One **dedicated Card Track**
- One **primary BPM range**
- One **House alignment**
- One **functional energy role**
- One **system interaction intent**

Optional variants (remixes, edits, live versions)  
may exist **only after** the primary Card Track is complete.

---

### 2.3 Card Track Categories (Prototype Phase)

For Prototype Phase I, the Card Track Canon consists of:

- **16 Card Tracks total**
- **4 Houses**
- **4 Cards per House**

This structure is intentional:
- It ensures parity between Houses
- It provides enough musical diversity to validate systems
- It avoids premature content sprawl

No additional Card Tracks may be added  
until this set is defined and acknowledged.

---

### 2.4 Canon Card Track Table — Prototype Phase I

The following table defines the **mandatory Card Tracks** for Prototype Phase I.

> Names marked *(WORKING)* may evolve.  
> Structure, role, and alignment may not.

---

| RYU-04 | *(TBD)* | *(WORKING)* | 175–195 | Harmony | System balance |

---

### 2.5 Canon Lock Rules — Card Tracks

Once a Card Track is declared:

- The **Card ↔ Track relationship** is permanent
- The **House alignment** may not change
- The **system intent** may not be contradicted

Future revisions may:
- refine arrangement,
- evolve sound design,
- improve clarity and power.

Future revisions may **not**:
- change the Card’s musical role,
- convert the track into a different function,
- detach the track from its Card.

---

### 2.6 Relationship to Other Systems

Card Tracks directly influence:

- **Combat Engine**  
  → timing pressure, escalation

- **Trigger Engine**  
  → Drop / Peak interaction

- **Player & Enemy Systems**  
  → perceived difficulty and flow

They are referenced by systems.  
They are not optional overlays.

---

## SECTION 3 — HOUSE ANTHEMS

### 3.0 Purpose of House Anthems

Each House within Resonantia represents a distinct philosophy of action,  
a way of engaging with rhythm, power, and consequence.

House Anthems exist to **embody these philosophies in sound**.

They are not:
- background loops,
- ambient fillers,
- optional themes.

They are **declarative works**.

To hear a House Anthem is to understand how that House:
- approaches force,
- values control or chaos,
- responds to pressure,
- interprets the Pulse.

---

### 3.1 Canon Status of House Anthems

Each House must possess **one primary anthem**.

This anthem is:
- canon-locked,
- long-form,
- representative of the House as a whole.

House Anthems may be:
- used in menus,
- used in trailers,
- used in live sets,
- referenced in narrative or ritual moments.

They are not tied to a single Card.  
They represent the **total identity** of the House.

---

### 3.2 Structural Requirements

Each House Anthem must conform to the following:

- Duration: **3–5 minutes**
- One dominant BPM identity (minor variation allowed)
- Clear escalation and release phases
- A recognizable sonic signature unique to the House

The anthem must be recognizable within its first 20–30 seconds.

---

### 3.3 Canon House Anthem Set — Prototype Phase I

The following House Anthems are **mandatory** for Prototype Phase I.

> Titles marked *(WORKING)* may evolve.  
> House identity and role may not.

---

#### 🜁 FENRIR — Anthem of the Wolf

| Attribute | Canon Value |
|---------|-------------|
| Working Title | *(TBD)* |
| BPM Identity | 200–220 |
| Core Traits | Aggression, momentum, primal force |
| Energy Curve | Immediate impact → sustained pressure |
| Sonic Language | Raw distortion, driving kicks, minimal restraint |
| Philosophical Role | Dominate before resistance can form |

Fenrir’s anthem does not wait.  
It **collides**.

---

#### 🜃 ANUBIS — Anthem of Judgment

| Attribute | Canon Value |
|---------|-------------|
| Working Title | *(TBD)* |
| BPM Identity | 150–175 |
| Core Traits | Control, endurance, inevitability |
| Energy Curve | Slow build → unyielding presence |
| Sonic Language | Heavy low-end, ritual rhythm, measured pacing |
| Philosophical Role | Survive, then decide |

Anubis does not rush.  
It **outlasts**.

---

#### 🜄 ONMYOJI — Anthem of the Bent Signal

| Attribute | Canon Value |
|---------|-------------|
| Working Title | *(TBD)* |
| BPM Identity | 170–200 |
| Core Traits | Disruption, deception, instability |
| Energy Curve | Irregular rise → fractured release |
| Sonic Language | Syncopation, glitch, warped timing |
| Philosophical Role | Break expectations, control confusion |

Onmyoji does not confront.  
It **unravels**.

---

#### 🜂 RYUJIN — Anthem of the Flowing Tide

| Attribute | Canon Value |
|---------|-------------|
| Working Title | *(TBD)* |
| BPM Identity | 165–190 |
| Core Traits | Flow, sustain, adaptation |
| Energy Curve | Gradual rise → harmonic equilibrium |
| Sonic Language | Rolling rhythms, evolving textures |
| Philosophical Role | Endure by adapting |

Ryujin does not resist.  
It **moves**.

---

### 3.4 Canon Lock Rules — House Anthems

Once a House Anthem is declared:

- The **House association** is permanent
- The **philosophical role** may not be altered
- The **BPM identity range** may not be contradicted

Revisions may:
- refine sound design,
- enhance clarity and impact,
- improve arrangement.

Revisions may **not**:
- repurpose the anthem,
- shift it to another House,
- undermine its identity.

---

### 3.5 Relationship to Other Music

House Anthems:

- inform the tone of all Card Tracks within the House,
- influence zone and menu music,
- act as the reference point for House-aligned Operatives.

They do not replace Card Tracks.  
They **anchor** them.

---

## SECTION 4 — THE OFFICIAL RESONANTIA ANTHEM

### 4.0 Purpose of the Official Anthem

The Official Resonantia Anthem is the **musical core** of Project Dissonance.

It does not represent a House.  
It does not represent a Card.  

It represents **the Pulse itself**.

This anthem is the first sound of the world  
and the last echo that remains when all systems fall silent.

If House Anthems are banners,  
the Official Anthem is the **origin signal**.

---

### 4.1 Canon Status

There exists **one** Official Resonantia Anthem.

It is:
- canon-locked,
- singular,
- irreplaceable.

No alternate anthem may supersede it.  
No House anthem may rival it.

Edits, evolutions, and refinements may exist,  
but all versions trace back to the same core identity.

---

### 4.2 Narrative and System Role

The Official Anthem fulfills multiple roles simultaneously:

- **Narrative Anchor**  
  It expresses the birth, fracture, and persistence of the Realm.

- **Systemic Reference**  
  It informs the tonal and rhythmic logic of all other music.

- **Ritual Threshold**  
  It marks entry, completion, and transcendence.

This anthem defines what *Resonantia sounds like*  
before any specialization occurs.

---

### 4.3 Structural Identity

The Official Anthem is not bound to a single tempo or genre.  
It is defined by **movement through states**.

Required characteristics:

- A clear **awakening phase**
- A **fracture or escalation phase**
- A **resonant convergence**
- A moment of **controlled silence or release**

These phases must be felt,  
even if they are not explicitly segmented.

---

### 4.4 BPM and Tempo Law

The Official Anthem may traverse multiple BPM ranges.

However:
- All tempo changes must feel **intentional**
- Transitions must reflect **systemic or narrative shifts**
- No section may feel arbitrary or decorative

The Anthem teaches the listener how to feel time  
before any combat begins.

---

### 4.5 Emotional Law

The Official Anthem must evoke:

- belonging without comfort,
- intensity without chaos,
- purpose without certainty,
- resolve without closure.

It should not promise victory.  
It should promise **meaning**.

This anthem welcomes the Operative  
not as a hero,  
but as a participant.

---

### 4.6 Usage Mandate

The Official Resonantia Anthem may be used for:

- game startup and title screen,
- major trailers,
- milestone announcements,
- canon-defining transmissions,
- closing sequences and credits.

It must **not** be diluted through overuse.

When it plays,  
it must matter.

---

### 4.7 Canon Lock Rules — Official Anthem

Once the Official Anthem is declared:

- Its **existence** is permanent
- Its **role** is immutable
- Its **identity** may not be replaced

Future versions may:
- expand arrangement,
- refine structure,
- improve production fidelity.

Future versions may **not**:
- contradict its emotional law,
- reduce its scope,
- fragment it into unrelated works.

---

### 4.8 Relationship to All Other Music

All other music in Project Dissonance is **downstream** from the Official Anthem.

- House Anthems inherit fragments of its language
- Card Tracks echo its timing philosophy
- System cues derive their gravity from it

If a piece of music conflicts with the Official Anthem,  
the anthem prevails.

---

## SECTION 5 — PRODUCTION OBLIGATIONS

### 5.0 Purpose of Production Obligations

This section defines what is **mandatory** for any musical work  
declared within the Music Canon.

These obligations exist to ensure that:
- canon is respected,
- systems remain coherent,
- music can be integrated without reinterpretation,
- future Operatives inherit stable foundations.

This section does not dictate *style*.  
It dictates **completeness**.

---

### 5.1 Mandatory Deliverables (All Canon Tracks)

Every canon-declared track — including:
- Card Tracks,
- House Anthems,
- the Official Resonantia Anthem,

must provide the following deliverables.

#### Required Assets

1. **Primary Master**
   - Lossless format (WAV or FLAC)
   - Full-length, uninterrupted version
   - No DJ intros or outros unless explicitly declared canon

2. **System-Ready Edit**
   - Trimmed or loop-safe version suitable for engine use
   - No abrupt starts or ends
   - Clean entry and exit points

3. **Track Metadata**
   - Canon track name
   - Associated Card / House / System
   - BPM (or BPM range)
   - Version identifier (v1.0, v1.1, etc.)

Without these, a track is considered **incomplete**.

---

### 5.2 Structural Integrity Requirements

All canon tracks must:

- maintain consistent tempo behavior within declared bounds,
- avoid unresolved clipping or distortion unless stylistically intentional,
- preserve clear rhythmic definition relevant to gameplay timing,
- respect declared energy roles (burst, sustain, disruption, etc.).

Experimental sound design is encouraged.  
Structural ambiguity is not.

---

### 5.3 Canon Compatibility

A track is considered **canon-compatible** only if:

- it fulfills its declared system role,
- it does not contradict the philosophy of its Card or House,
- it integrates cleanly with timing-driven systems.

A track may be musically impressive  
and still be **canon-invalid**.

Canon is not about taste.  
It is about alignment.

---

### 5.4 Versioning Rules

All canon tracks follow strict versioning.

- Initial declaration: **v1.0**
- Incremental refinements: **v1.1, v1.2, etc.**
- Major structural revision (same identity): **v2.0**

Version changes must:
- preserve core identity,
- respect Canon Lock Rules defined earlier,
- be logged in accompanying documentation.

Deleting or overwriting earlier versions is prohibited.

---

### 5.5 Prohibited Practices

The following are explicitly disallowed for canon tracks:

- placeholder tracks marked as final,
- reusing non-canon tracks without declaration,
- silent replacement of existing canon works,
- detaching music from its declared system role.

Violation of these rules breaks canon integrity  
and must be corrected before further production continues.

---

### 5.6 Responsibility and Accountability

Any Operative contributing music to Project Dissonance  
accepts responsibility for:

- understanding this Codex,
- delivering complete assets,
- respecting system requirements.

Failure to meet obligations does not disqualify the Operative.  
It disqualifies the **submission**.

Canon integrity always takes priority over speed.

---

### 5.7 Readiness for Workflow Binding

Once production obligations are understood and accepted,  
execution workflows may be applied.

The next section defines the **canonical production workflow**  
for the primary DAW environment.

---

## SECTION 6 — FL STUDIO 2024: CANONICAL WORKFLOW BINDING

### 6.0 Purpose of Workflow Binding

This section defines the **canonical production workflow**  
for all music created under the Music Canon of Project Dissonance  
using **FL Studio Producer Edition 2024**.

The purpose is not to restrict creativity.  
It is to guarantee:

- reproducibility,
- consistency,
- system compatibility,
- future-proof collaboration.

Any track produced in FL Studio that claims canon status  
must adhere to this workflow.

---

### 6.1 Canonical DAW Authority

For Prototype Phase I:

- **FL Studio Producer Edition 2024** is the sole canonical DAW.
- All reference workflows assume FL Studio behavior and structure.
- Other DAWs may be added later via parallel binding sections.

Tracks produced outside FL Studio during this phase  
may exist as sketches, but **cannot be declared canon**  
until they are conformed to this workflow.

---

### 6.2 Project File Structure (Mandatory)

Every canon track must reside in a structured project folder.

#### Required Structure

<TRACK_ID><TRACK_NAME>/
├── 00_PROJECT/
│ └── <TRACK_ID><TRACK_NAME>vX.X.flp
├── 01_AUDIO/
│ ├── STEMS/
│ └── RENDERS/
├── 02_EXPORT/
│ ├── MASTER/
│ └── SYSTEM_EDIT/
├── 03_NOTES/
│ └── <TRACK_ID><TRACK_NAME>_Production_Notes.md
No additional folders may be introduced  
without justification and documentation.

---

### 6.3 Naming Conventions (Non-Negotiable)

#### FL Studio Project File

<TRACK_ID>_<TRACK_NAME>_vX.X.flp
Example:
FEN-01_Bloodbound_v1.0.flp

#### Exported Audio

- Master:
<TRACK_ID>_<TRACK_NAME>_MASTER_vX.X.wav

- System Edit:
<TRACK_ID>_<TRACK_NAME>_SYSTEM_vX.X.wav

Naming consistency is mandatory for:
- asset tracking,
- version control,
- engine ingestion.

---

### 6.4 FL Studio Session Requirements

Each FL Studio session must:

- use a **fixed BPM** within declared canon range,
- have tempo automation **explicitly documented** if used,
- avoid unresolved red clipping on the master channel,
- preserve clean bar alignment for drops and transitions.

Required Mixer Discipline:

- Master channel reserved for:
  - gentle limiting,
  - safety gain,
  - no creative distortion.
- Creative processing belongs on buses or channels, not Master.

---

### 6.5 Arrangement Discipline

Canon tracks must be arranged with **system awareness**.

This means:

- clear intro zone (even if aggressive),
- identifiable escalation points,
- readable rhythmic structure,
- intentional breakdowns or releases.

Random or unstructured arrangements  
may be musically interesting  
but are not canon-compatible.

---

### 6.6 Automation & Modulation Rules

Automation is encouraged  
but must obey the following:

- No automation may obscure the core pulse.
- Rhythmic clarity must be preserved.
- Automation clips must be named meaningfully.

Example:
FILTER_SWEEP_DROP_01
Unnamed automation is prohibited.

---

### 6.7 Export & Bounce Settings (Baseline)

While exact mastering chains may evolve,  
the following baseline rules apply:

- Sample Rate: **44.1 kHz or 48 kHz**
- Bit Depth: **24-bit**
- Dithering: **Off** unless final distribution requires it
- Normalize: **Off**
- Tail Rendering: **Enabled**

Silence trimming must be deliberate  
and not automatic.

---

### 6.8 Documentation Obligation

Each canon track must include  
a `Production_Notes.md` file containing:

- declared Card / House / System role,
- BPM and tempo behavior,
- version history summary,
- known limitations or future intents.

If the project cannot be understood  
without opening the FLP,  
it is insufficiently documented.

---

### 6.9 Canon Validation Checklist

Before a track may be declared canon-complete:

- [ ] File naming follows canon
- [ ] Folder structure is intact
- [ ] BPM matches declared range
- [ ] Required exports exist
- [ ] Notes are complete
- [ ] Track fulfills its system role

If any item fails,  
the track remains **non-canon**.

---

### 6.10 Future DAW Parity

Additional DAWs (LMMS, Ableton, Reaper, etc.)  
may be added in later phases.

Each will require:
- a dedicated workflow binding section,
- parity with FL Studio rules,
- explicit approval.

Until then,  
FL Studio remains the canonical execution environment.

---

## SECTION 7 — VERSIONING, EVOLUTION & CANON GOVERNANCE

### 7.0 Purpose of Canon Governance

This section defines how the Music Canon:
- evolves without fragmenting,
- improves without erasing history,
- remains authoritative across time and contributors.

Canon governance exists to protect:
- continuity,
- clarity,
- legacy.

Without governance, canon becomes opinion.  
With governance, it becomes inheritance.

---

### 7.1 Canon Versioning Model

The Music Canon & Production Codex follows strict semantic versioning.

- **v1.0** — Initial Canon Declaration  
  Establishes all required musical entities and laws.

- **v1.x** — Clarification & Expansion  
  May:
  - refine language,
  - add implementation detail,
  - lock additional Card names or titles.

  May **not**:
  - remove declared obligations,
  - contradict earlier canon.

- **v2.0** — Canon Expansion  
  Introduces new phases (e.g. new Houses, new Card sets, new Anthems).

Major versions represent **growth**, not correction.

---

### 7.2 Track-Level Versioning

Individual tracks are versioned independently of the Codex.

- **v1.0** — First canon-complete version
- **v1.x** — Iterative refinement
- **v2.0** — Major structural evolution (same identity)

Track versions must:
- preserve declared system role,
- maintain House or Card alignment,
- remain compatible with canon law at the time of declaration.

Older versions are never deleted.  
They remain part of the archive.

---

### 7.3 Canon Lock Points

Certain elements are permanently locked once declared:

- Existence of a required track
- Association between:
  - Card ↔ Track
  - House ↔ Anthem
- Role of the Official Resonantia Anthem

These elements may evolve in form,  
but **never in purpose**.

Canon lock points prevent:
- retroactive erasure,
- identity drift,
- fragmentation of meaning.

---

### 7.4 Authority and Stewardship

Final authority over the Music Canon rests with:

- The **Project Dissonance Canon Keeper**
- Acting in alignment with:
  - the Living Bible,
  - the Technical Codex,
  - the long-term vision of Resonantia.

Contributors may propose:
- new tracks,
- revisions,
- expansions.

They may not unilaterally alter canon.

---

### 7.5 Proposal and Review Process

All canon changes follow a simple rule:

> **Declare. Review. Then bind.**

A proposal must:
- state intent clearly,
- reference affected systems,
- justify alignment with existing canon.

No change is considered canon  
until it is explicitly recorded in this Codex  
and versioned accordingly.

---

### 7.6 Conflict Resolution

If a conflict arises between:
- musical execution and canon law,
- contributor preference and system need,
- legacy content and future direction,

then:

1. Canon law takes precedence
2. System coherence takes priority
3. Legacy is preserved where possible

Music may be rewritten.  
Canon is not.

---

### 7.7 Archival Responsibility

All canon documents and tracks must be:

- version-controlled,
- archived,
- recoverable.

Loss of history is considered a system failure.

Every evolution must leave a trail  
that future Operatives can follow.

---

### 7.8 Closing Declaration

This Codex is not a limitation.  
It is a foundation.

It exists so that:
- creativity can scale,
- collaboration can survive,
- meaning can endure.

With this document:
- music becomes law,
- law becomes structure,
- structure becomes resonance.

The Music Canon is now **sealed**.

## SECTION A — CARD TRACK SOUND PALETTES

### A1 — FEN-01_SURGE: KICK_SURGE LAW

#### Role & Intent

KICK_SURGE is not a groove element.  
It is the **pulse hammer** of Fenrir — a forward-driving force that enforces momentum.

If a kick feels fun to dance to, it is incorrect.  
If it feels like it forces motion, it is correct.

KICK_SURGE represents inevitability, not enjoyment.

---

#### Shape Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

KICK_SURGE must exhibit:

- Fast transient
- Short to medium tail
- No extended decay
- No rounded or soft body

Explicit exclusions:

- No boomy techno kicks
- No long 909-style tails
- No round EDM-style kicks
- No click-only transient kicks

The kick must resolve fully before the next hit at 202 BPM.

---

#### Frequency Ownership

- Primary weight: ~50–65 Hz
- Punch zone: ~90–120 Hz
- Click presence: controlled, never sharp

Canonical rule:

> The kick owns low-end timing.  
> The bass owns low-end sustain.

In any conflict, the kick wins.

---

#### Mono & Spatial Law

- KICK_SURGE is 100% mono
- Center-positioned only
- No stereo widening
- No chorus
- No reverb on the main body

If widening feels necessary, the sound choice is invalid.

---

#### Emotional Validation

When soloed, KICK_SURGE must feel:

- Unmusical
- Unpleasant
- Inevitable

The correct response is not enjoyment, but submission to force.

---

---

### A2 — FEN-01_SURGE: SUB_SURGE & BASS_SURGE RELATIONSHIP LAW

#### Role Separation (Absolute)

SURGE employs three low-frequency authorities:

- **KICK_SURGE** — timing, command, impact  
- **SUB_SURGE** — weight, pressure, mass  
- **BASS_SURGE** — aggression, sustain, grind  

These roles must never blur.

If role boundaries collapse, power collapses.

---

#### Frequency Ownership (Non-Negotiable)

**SUB_SURGE**

- Operates below ~50 Hz
- No meaningful energy above ~70 Hz
- No midrange character
- Exists only to reinforce mass

**BASS_SURGE**

- Primary body between ~70–180 Hz
- Aggression harmonics above, controlled
- Must never compete with SUB_SURGE below ~50 Hz

Canonical hierarchy:

> SUB is weight.  
> BASS is aggression.  
> KICK is command.

---

#### Timing & Envelope Law

**SUB_SURGE**

- Always ducked or sidechained by KICK_SURGE
- Fast release, clean recovery
- Never overlaps kick transient

**BASS_SURGE**

- May overlap after kick impact
- Must never mask kick transient
- Allowed to swell, grind, or pulse only post-impact

Flab, wobble, or smear indicates violation of canon.

---

#### Mono & Stereo Law

- **SUB_SURGE**
  - 100% mono
  - Center only
  - No stereo processing under any circumstance

- **BASS_SURGE**
  - Low core remains mono
  - Stereo harmonics allowed above ~150 Hz only
  - Width is a controlled enhancement, never foundational

If low-end feels wide, the law is broken.

---

#### Emotional Validation

When isolated:

- SUB_SURGE must feel oppressive and heavy
- BASS_SURGE must feel angry and grinding

Combined with KICK_SURGE:

> The listener must feel forward pressure, not bounce.

---

---

### A3 — FEN-01_SURGE: LEAD_SURGE & STAB_SURGE SYNTH LANGUAGE LAW

#### Role Definition

**LEAD_SURGE**

- Issues direction
- Signals attack windows
- Functions as a command signal

**STAB_SURGE**

- Delivers impact punctuation
- Reinforces drops and structural hits
- Confirms force rather than narrating it

LEAD points.  
STAB strikes.

They are not interchangeable.

---

#### Melodic Law (Strict)

**LEAD_SURGE**

- Minimal pitch movement
- Short motifs, never full melodies
- Repetition with intent
- Rhythm takes precedence over harmony

Allowed:

- 1–3 note phrases
- Stepwise motion
- Micro-variation

Forbidden:

- Long melodic runs
- Emotional chord progressions
- Heroic or singable lines

If it can be comfortably hummed, it violates canon.

---

**STAB_SURGE**

- Single-note or dyad hits only
- No melodic movement
- Exists solely to reinforce rhythm and structure

STAB does not tell a story.  
It punctuates one.

---

#### Timing & Rhythm Law

**LEAD_SURGE**

- Grid-locked timing
- Emphasis on off-beat tension
- Never anticipates the kick

**STAB_SURGE**

- Coincides with kick impacts, drops, or structural accents
- Never floats
- Never anticipates

Playfulness in timing violates Fenrir law.

---

#### Frequency & Space Law

**LEAD_SURGE**

- Midrange-focused
- Must never invade sub or kick space
- Controlled upper presence allowed

**STAB_SURGE**

- Sharp transient
- Narrow bandwidth
- Immediate space after impact

Neither may mask:

- kick transient
- bass aggression
- sub weight

---

#### Modulation & Motion

- Automation is permitted
- Movement must feel mechanical, not expressive

Allowed:

- filter pulses
- rhythmic gating
- subtle pitch modulation

Forbidden:

- emotional vibrato
- evolving pads
- ambient washes

---

#### Emotional Validation

When isolated:

- LEAD_SURGE must feel commanding and cold
- STAB_SURGE must feel violent and final

Together:

> They should feel like orders being given and enforced.

---

---

### A4 — FEN-01_SURGE: FX_SURGE, NOISE_SURGE & CONTROL BOUNDARIES

#### Role of FX in SURGE

FX in SURGE exist to reinforce force, not decorate it.

They serve to:

- emphasize transitions,
- reinforce impact,
- clarify structure.

They must never:

- distract from rhythm,
- introduce narrative emotion,
- add groove or atmosphere.

If FX draw attention to themselves, they violate canon.

---

#### FX_SURGE Law (General FX)

FX_SURGE may include:

- short impacts,
- reverses,
- metallic hits,
- noise bursts.

Constraints:

- short duration,
- purpose-bound,
- event-triggered.

Forbidden:

- long risers,
- atmospheric beds,
- melodic FX,
- cinematic swells.

FX_SURGE reinforces moments, not space.

---

#### RISE_SURGE Law (Transition Control)

RISE_SURGE exists solely to:

- signal imminent structural change,
- build pressure before drops,
- prepare impact.

Rules:

- always terminates at a structural marker,
- never resolves softly,
- never bleeds into the drop.

Allowed:

- noise-based rises,
- filter sweeps,
- pitch ramps.

Forbidden:

- melodic risers,
- emotional crescendos,
- uplifting or cinematic behavior.

A rise must feel like tension tightening, not anticipation of joy.

---

#### IMPACT_SURGE Law (Structural Emphasis)

IMPACT_SURGE:

- coincides with DROP or PEAK,
- reinforces kick dominance,
- adds weight rather than brightness.

Rules:

- short and decisive,
- low–mid focused,
- never masks kick transient.

If the impact is heard more than felt, it is incorrect.

---

#### NOISE_SURGE Law (Controlled Chaos)

NOISE_SURGE exists to:

- add aggression texture,
- enhance brutality,
- introduce controlled chaos.

Rules:

- noise is shaped, not free,
- no constant noise beds,
- no wide stereo noise in the low range.

Allowed:

- gated noise,
- transient noise hits,
- rhythm-bound distortion textures.

Forbidden:

- ambience,
- wash,
- drift,
- uncontrolled stereo spread.

Noise must feel weaponized, not atmospheric.

---

#### Automation Boundary Law

Automation is permitted only if it:

- reinforces rhythm,
- clarifies structure,
- increases pressure.

Forbidden automation:

- slow emotional fades,
- ambient filter sweeps,
- cinematic build-ups.

Automation must feel mechanical and intentional.

---

#### Emotional Validation

When FX are soloed, they should feel:

- functional,
- harsh,
- unapologetic.

When FX are muted, the track must still function perfectly.

FX enhance SURGE; they never carry it.
