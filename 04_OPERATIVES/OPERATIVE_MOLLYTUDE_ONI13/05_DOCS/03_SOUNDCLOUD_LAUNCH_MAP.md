## 3. BIOGRAPHY

### SHORT BIO

Hard Techno // Acid // Uptempo Industrial from a dual identity:  
human signal + masked machine-spirit.

### FULL BIO

MollyTude // ONI13 is a dual identity forged from pressure and rhythm.  
Molly is the human signal; ONI13 is the masked machine-frequency that expresses  
what she cannot show. Together they forge mechanical rituals of hard techno,  
spiraling acid, and industrial atmospheres built for dark rooms, heavy systems,  
and honest volume. Anonymous, but fully present.
