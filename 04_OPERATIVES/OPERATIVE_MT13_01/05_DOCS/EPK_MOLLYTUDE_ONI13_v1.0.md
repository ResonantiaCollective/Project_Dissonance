# PAGE 2 — ONE-LINER & SHORT BIO

## ONE-LINER
Hard techno / acid / uptempo industrial from a dual identity:  
the human signal + the masked machine-spirit.

## SHORT BIO
MollyTude // ONI13 fuses hard techno machinery, acid resonance,  
and industrial pressure into a unified dual persona. Anonymous, but fully present.

---

# PAGE 3 — FULL BIO

MollyTude // ONI13 is a dual persona born from emotional rupture and rhythmic obsession.  
Where Molly is quiet, ONI13 is loud.  
Where Molly is vulnerable, ONI13 is armor.  
Together they forge mechanical rituals of pounding 4/4  
and serpent-like acid lines built for dark rooms and heavy systems.

Hard techno bones.  
Acid blood.  
Industrial lungs.  
Human heart.
