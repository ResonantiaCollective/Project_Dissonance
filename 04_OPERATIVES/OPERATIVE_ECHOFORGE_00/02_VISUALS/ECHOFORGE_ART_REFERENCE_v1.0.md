# ECHOFORGE — ARTWORK REFERENCE SHEET v1.0  
## Operative 00 — Founder-Class | Cyber–Norse Oni | Dual Resonance

This document contains the *technical* specifications for Echo//Forge’s visual production.  
Paired with the Artwork Blueprint, this serves as the master reference for:

- concept artists  
- character artists  
- VFX  
- animators  
- UI designers  
- merch teams  
- branding

# I. CHARACTER PROPORTIONS

**Height:** 1.86m  
**Build:** Lean-power (not bulky, not skinny)  
**Silhouette focus:**  
- asymmetry with balance  
- long coat forming a “V” shape  
- extended forearms (Wolf side exaggerated ~3–5%)  

**Proportional notes:**  
- Wolf arm = slightly longer, more tension line  
- Oni arm = more controlled, straight angles  
- Hands = Wolf side slightly clawed, Oni side precise

---

# II. HEAD & MASK DETAILS

### A. Half-Mask Split
Vertical split at eyebrow line.

**Left Side (Fenrir Skull Plate)**  
- matte bone-gray base  
- glowing cracks (red gradient)  
- subtle runes along cheekbone  
- glowing Wolf eye

**Right Side (Oni Plate)**  
- polished dark-blue alloy  
- angular cheek vents  
- glowing blue forehead sigils  
- human eye visible  

### B. Hair
- partially visible on Oni side  
- dark with red-blue reflective fibers  
- optional: slight upward resonance lift during ability states

---

# III. MATERIAL DEFINITIONS

### Clothing & Armor  
| Material | Usage | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Graphite Nano-Weave | Undersuit | absorbs light, matte finish |
| Fenrir Leather | Wolf-side coat panels | rugged, torn edges |
| Oni Alloy Plates | Oni-side shoulder + forearm | reflective, geometric |
| Resonance Thread | Coat trim | glows red/blue depending on mode |
| Pulse Glass | Resonance rings | semi-transparent energy |

---

# IV. COLOR LAYERING (HEX-CODE ACCURATE)

### Primary  
- **Founder Black:** `#1A1A1F`  
- **Fenrir Red:** `#BA1E1E`  
- **Oni Blue:** `#2EA7DD`  

### Secondary  
- **Pulse Pink:** `#E42AA8`  
- **Cyber Cyan:** `#3CEBF0`  
- **Bone Gray (Fenrir Mask):** `#A3A3A6`  

### Lighting Rules  
- Wolf side receives warmer, harsher rim-light  
- Oni side receives cooler, sharper rim-light  
- In Dual Resonance state → both lights flicker in sync (2–6 beat cycle)

---

# V. OUTFIT LAYER STACK (TOP → BOTTOM)

1. **Outer Coat**  
   - left = torn fur edge  
   - right = armored panel  
   - long rear split  
   - resonance trim

2. **Mid-layer**  
   - chest harness with sigil slot  
   - optional coat clasps (Oni side)

3. **Undersuit**  
   - graphene black pattern  
   - minor red/blue linework

4. **Boots**  
   - metal heel  
   - red/blue underglow  
   - stomp-responsive LEDs

- glowing red filament  
- sparks + distortion edges  
- optional “jaw fragment” projections on charge

### B. Oni Sigil (Right Hand)

- clean perfect neon-blue lines  
- geometric inscriptions  

### C. Combined Sigil — **∞ Loop**

- rotates on two axes  
- color blend: red → violet → blue  

### Emission Points

- forearm resonance lines  
- chest harness core

# VII. POSE SHEET REFERENCES

### A. “Origin Node Pose” (Primary)
- Wolf arm extended, energy gathering  
- Oni arm drawn back  
- Dual resonance rings behind  
- Half-mask fully activated  

### B. Neutral Standing Pose

- resonance low  
- human eye soft  
- Wolf eye dim but visible  

### C. Aggressive Pose  
- Wolf side dominates  
- claws extended  
- oni side shadows deepen  

### D. Focused Pose

# VIII. EXPRESSION SHEET

Even with half-mask, expression must be readable:

| Mode | Oni Eye | Wolf Eye | Mask Notes |
|------|---------|----------|------------|
| Neutral | normal | dim glow | minimal crack lines |
| Wolf Mode | narrowed | intense red | cracks brighten |
| Oni Mode | sharp | soft | forehead sigils glow |
| Dual Resonance | flickering | flickering | mask seam glows violet |
| Overdrive | wide | blazing | plates fracture with energy |

# IX. AURA & VFX TECHNICAL NOTES

### Base Aura  
- radius: 1.1m  
- strength: 0.4 opacity  

### Switch Shockwave  
- distortion: sine outward ripple  
- color: violet  
- duration: 0.35s  

### Movement Trails  
Wolf: heat-streak, warm bloom  
Oni: neon-streak with chromatic split  

### Ability VFX  
**Founder’s Resonance:**  
- background joints collapse inward  
- crest manifests behind character  
- global color curve shifts slightly warm-to-cool  

---

# X. TURNAROUND SHEET (REQUIRED VIEWS)

Artists producing the model need:

- front  
- back  
- left side  
- right side  
- 3/4 view  
- mask close-up  
- hand sigil close-ups  
- boot + coat detail  

All views must reflect both Wolf and Oni energy differences.

---

# XI. SCALE RELATION TO OTHER OPERATIVES

Echo//Forge stands visually above standard operatives through:

- larger resonance rings  
- stronger silhouette  
- more complex mask  
- dual lighting  

But should not appear oversized or monstrous.

He is **mythic human**, not beast.

---

# XII. FILE EXPORT GUIDELINES

For art production:

- PNG for transparent assets  
- TIFF for master files  
- SVG for sigils  
- MP4 for animated loops  
- PSD for layered character sheets  

Naming convention:

ECHOFORGE_v1_poseXX.ext
ECHOFORGE_sigils_v1.xx
ECHOFORGE_turnaround_v1.xx
