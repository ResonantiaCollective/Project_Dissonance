ECHOFORGE_SIGIL_WOLF_ONI_DUAL_RESONANCE_v1.0.png

**Description:**  
The Core Sigil depicts a Wolf–Oni hybrid visage suspended between two opposing resonance rings.  
Red (Fenrir) and Blue (Oni) form an infinite loop, representing eternal duality, controlled fury, and founder equilibrium.

**Symbolic Meaning:**
- Wolf — Instinct, protection, ferocity, leadership
- Oni — Discipline, inner demon mastered, cyber-spiritual control
- Dual Rings (∞) — Signal ↔ Counter-Signal, Creation ↔ Constraint
- Central Core — The Founder as stabilizing axis

This sigil represents the **origin frequency** of Resonantia.
