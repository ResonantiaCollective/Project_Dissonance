This document provides the orthographic references for artists and 3D modelers.

# I. FRONT VIEW (A1)

**Posture:**  
- Spine straight, shoulders squared  
- Wolf arm (left) slightly extended  
- Oni arm (right) relaxed but precise  

**Key visual markers:**  
- Half-mask split visibly centered  
- ∞ resonance ring behind back  
- Coat symmetric from front despite dual materials  
- Color gradient subtle (red glow left → blue glow right)

---

# II. SIDE VIEW — LEFT (Wolf Side) (A2)

**Wolf-side definers:**  
- Slight forward lean  
- Exposed musculature lines under coat slit  
- Red resonance veins running from neck → shoulder → forearm  
- Wolf jaw plate silhouette visible even from side  

---

# III. SIDE VIEW — RIGHT (Oni Side) (A3)

**Oni-side definers:**  
- Clean, straight posture  
- Blue resonance sigils visible on shoulder plate  
- Oni mask curvature pronounced from jawline  
- Coat armor plating defined with geometric precision

---

# IV. BACK VIEW (A4)

**Back markers:**  
- Full ∞ resonance ring visible  
- Coat split reveals underlayer hex mesh  
- Red → blue gradient across shoulders (subtle)  
- Hair tied / partially free on Oni side  

---

# V. THREE-QUARTER VIEW (A5)

This is the **primary modeling reference**.

Must show:  
- duality of form  
- red and blue rim lights  
- mask transition glow  
- both sigils faintly active  

---

# VI. SCALE

Compared to standard Operative silhouette:  
- +5% height illusion due to coat flare  
- resonance rings increase silhouette footprint  

---

# VII. NOTES FOR ARTISTS

- DO NOT exaggerate monster traits — Echo//Forge is mythic human.  
- Wolf side = chaos energy, Oni side = structured energy.  
- Coat must move as two materials fused into one.  
- Resonance ring must remain behind spine axis (never in front).
