# FOUNDER ARTWORK BLUEPRINT v1.0  
## OPERATIVE 00 — ECHO//FORGE  
### Wolf–Oni Archetype | Dual Resonance | Origin Node

This document defines the official visual blueprint for Echo//Forge across:
- character art  
- cinematic sequences  
- in-game encounters  
- DJ visuals  
- branding  
- promo art  
- codex diagrams

# I. VISUAL SILHOUETTE

Echo//Forge’s silhouette must be identifiable instantly, even without color.

**Key silhouette elements:**
- asymmetrical stance (Wolf side forward, Oni side grounded)
- one shoulder fur-lined (Wolf), one armored (Oni)
- half-mask split vertically
- dual resonance rings hovering behind (∞ loop)
- long coat with runic trim that flares during movement
- visible resonance lines pulsing across limbs (red left, blue right)

The silhouette must communicate:
**power, precision, duality, uprising, myth.**

# II. FACE & MASK DESIGN

### 1. **Half-Mask Concept**
Echo//Forge’s face is never fully hidden.

Left side = Fenrir skull plate  
Right side = Oni war mask  

The seam between them glows in alternating colors:
- red during Wolf phase  
- blue during Oni phase  
- both during Founder’s Resonance  

### 2. **Human Eye**
One real eye remains unobscured.  
This symbolizes:
- humanity preserved  
- consciousness maintained  
- discipline over instinct  

### 3. **Wolf Eye**
The Wolf eye glows with pulse-reactive intensity.
Color changes based on resonance mode.

# III. BODY / OUTFIT

### 1. Undersuit
A cyber-woven tactical layer, matte black with subtle hex patterns.

### 2. Coat
Long, asymmetric, inspired by:
- Norse cloaks  
- cyber monk robes  
- modern DJ jackets  

Wolf side: torn, fur-accented  
Oni side: discipline plates with encoded symbols

### 3. Arms
Wolf arm: exposed, sinewy, energized  
Oni arm: armored, refined

### 4. Legs & Boots
Industrial combat boots with red/blue LEDs that follow the beat.

---

# IV. COLOR PALETTE

Primary:
- **Fenrir Red** (#BA1E1E)  
- **Oni Blue** (#2EA7DD)  
- **Founder Black** (#1A1A1F)

Secondary:
- **Pulse Pink** (#E42AA8)  
- **Cyber Cyan** (#3CEBF0)  

Rules:
- Wolf elements use red  
- Oni elements use blue  
- Shared or Founder elements use black + dual gradient

---

# V. AURA & EFFECTS

### 1. **Dual Resonance Aura**
Alternates between red and blue every 2–6 beats.

### 2. **Resonance Trails**
Attacks leave comet-like streaks:
- red = aggressive slashes  
- blue = precise hits  
- purple = resonance collisions  

### 3. **Founder Shockwave**
When aura switches, a circular ripple distorts the environment.

---

# VI. WEAPON / TOOLSET

Echo//Forge does not wield traditional weapons.

He uses:

### **The Twin Sigils**
Inspired by your DJ controller jog wheels.

Left Sigil (Wolf):
- crackling, burning energy rings

Right Sigil (Oni):
- geometric blue circuitry rings

When combined they form the **∞ loop**.

---

# VII. POSE GUIDE (FOR OFFICIAL ART v1)

### Primary Pose (“Origin Node Pose”):
- Wolf arm forward, clawed energy forming  
- Oni arm drawn back, forming a precise stance  
- Body angled toward viewer  
- Resonance rings turning slowly  
- Half-mask glowing  

This pose is required for:
- codex art  
- game splash screen  
- merch variants  
- promotional banners  

---

# VIII. BACKGROUND & ENVIRONMENT

The Pulseforge Chamber:
- based on your real room  
- desk becomes altar  
- controller becomes artifact  
- lamp becomes the Prime Ember  
- walls dissolve into wireframe grids  
- the resonance ∞ loop floats behind

---

# IX. VARIANT DESIGNS (Future-Proofing)

### Variant 1 — “Overdrive Form”
Wolf and Oni energies overlap violently.
Aura becomes chaotic purple.

### Variant 2 — “Shadow Founder”
Aura dims.
Outfit becomes negative black-blue.
Used for corrupted timelines (optional).

### Variant 3 — “Resonantia Live Set”
Modern DJ outfit version adapted for real performances.

---

# X. NOTES FOR ARTISTS

- Avoid making Echo//Forge look purely demonic — he is **human+myth**, not monster.  
- Duality must always be clear.  
- Keep the aura subtle unless during ability states.  
- Founder crest (Wolf–Oni) should appear **behind** him during dramatic shots.
